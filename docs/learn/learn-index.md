Welcome to the learner's section of the Polkadot Wiki.

Here, you will be able to learn how the Polkadot network works from the ground up - from how
accounts on Polkadot, to the protocols that power the Polkadot network. If you are looking to begin
your learning journey, whether you're a developer or someone who is just getting started with
blockchain.

There are a series of video tutorials which are also provided, which you may
[find here](./learn-video-tutorials.md).
